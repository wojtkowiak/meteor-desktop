#### v1.1.0 <sup>23.05.2018</sup>
* `setDefaultFetchTimeout` and `call` methods added to both `Module` and `Desktop`

**FIXES**
* fix [#165](https://github.com/wojtkowiak/meteor-desktop/issues/174) `meteor://` protocol is now registered as secure 
* `meteor-desktop-splash-screen` received a fix for window size issues in Electron 2.0 (you should update to `4.0.2`) 
* `bundler` caching was disabled for production builds as you might have accidentally get a development `desktop.asar` build into your production build

## v1.0.0 <sup>21.05.2018</sup>
Meteor App serving mechanism was changed to utilise `registerStreamProtocol` and serve 
the app on constant `meteor://desktop` url instead of setting a http server which serves over `http://127.0.0.1:<random_port_on_every_start>`.

This finally solves the longstanding problems with `IndexedDB` and `localstorage` not being persistent.

Please verify thoroughly if your app is working fine after this change and reports any problems you encounter.

The localstorage contents will be migrated if you are updating your app from pre `1.0.0`.

However if you are using the `meteor-desktop-localstorage` plugin you have to make a migration yourself. The easiest way is to copy the plugin desktop code as your module in `.desktop` and on your app start get the contents with `getAll` and save them to the browser's localstorage.     

* [`electron`](https://github.com/electron/electron) was updated to `2.0.1`
* `MD_LOG_LEVEL` is now respected
* `-d`/`--debug` option added to run electron with `--debug=5858` switch
* `beforeLocalServerInit` event added to the `eventsBus`
* `METEOR_DESKTOP_DEBUG` now produces a lot more info from bundler plugin while building meteor project 
* default installer in the scaffold for Windows is now set to `nsis`

**DEPRECATIONS:**
* builtin support for squirrel auto update

**BREAKING:**
* support for the `meteor-desktop-localstorage` plugin is removed, you will not be able to use this plugin anymore

## v0.19.0 <sup>17.05.2018</sup>

it's more than sure that you will have to update your [`electron-builder`](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder)/[`electron-packager`](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager) configuration since it's a big shift from the old versions, create a new meteor project with blank scaffold (`npm run desktop -- init`) and take a look a the new `settings.json` as that might give you some hints
