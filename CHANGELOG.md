#### v0.14.0 <sup>14.03.2018</sup>
* upgraded to `babel@7`, which is now used to compile both the meteor-desktop itself and the produced app
* upgraded to `uglify-es`   
* `electron-builder` was updated to `20.5.1`   
* `electron-builder-squirrel-windows` was updated to `20.5.0`
 


#### v0.13.0 <sup>09.03.2018</sup>
* `electron` was updated to `1.7.12`
* `npm` has been removed from being a direct dependency, dependencies installation is now performed entirely by `electron-builder` which calls your `meteor npm` or system's `npm`
* local npm dependencies (`file:`) are now installed by [`install-local`](https://github.com/nicojs/node-install-local)
* native modules rebuild mechanism is enabled by default now and there is no way of turning it off (`rebuildNativeNodeModules` is obsolete and no longer taken into account)
* several small improvements to `electron-builder` integration

#### v0.12.0 <sup>23.02.2018</sup>
* `electron-builder` was updated to `20.0.8`   
* `electron-builder-squirrel-windows` was updated to `20.0.5`
* `electron-packager` was updated to `11.0.1`
* **DEPRECATIONS**:
    - building for `squirrel.windows` is not encouraged and from `1.0.0` the default Windows target will be `nsis`  

it's more than sure that you will have to update your `electron-builder`/`electron-packaged` configuration since it's a big shift from the old versions, create a new meteor project with blank scaffold (`npm run desktop -- init`) and take a look a the new `settings.json` as that might give you some hints
