## v2.1.0 <sup>xx.xx.2019</sup>

* Update some dependencies and fixes some vulnerabilities
* Added support for Electron 5 (by [`KoenLav`](https://github.com/KoenLav) in [`#227`](https://github.com/wojtkowiak/meteor-desktop/pull/227))
* Allow config header Access-Control-Allow-Origin on LocalServer module (by [`cbh6`](https://github.com/cbh6) in [`#216`](https://github.com/wojtkowiak/meteor-desktop/pull/216))
* Fix mas build (by [`wojtkowiak`](https://github.com/wojtkowiak)) in [`#214`](https://github.com/wojtkowiak/meteor-desktop/pull/214))
* Update default electron version to latest (6.0.1)
* Added support for private npm repository

## v2.0.0 <sup>02.10.2018</sup>

The main aim of this version is to decouple `electron`, `electron-builder` and `electron-packager` from this package.
Until now every `meteor-desktop` release came with specific versions of those pinned to it.
Now you are free to use any version with your meteor project. Just add them to your `devDependencies`.
If you will not, `meteor-desktop` adds the recommended versions automatically when needed.

From now every `meteor-desktop` release will provide a recommended versions numbers of these dependencies.
By default I will try to make `meteor-desktop` compatible within the compatibility version of the recommended version i.e. if the recommended electron version is `2.0.10` you should still be able to use any `2.x.x` version without problems.

**Recommended versions:**
* [`electron`](https://github.com/electron/electron) -> `2.0.10`
* [`electron-builder`](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder) -> `20.28.4`


**BREAKING:**
* support for Squirrel autoupdate mechanism ended, if you wish to continue with it, add the `electron-builder-squirrel-windows` dependency to your `devDependencies` and move it's settings to `squirrel` section in settings i.e.:
    ```
        "squirrel": {
            "autoUpdateFeedUrl": "http://127.0.0.1/update/:platform/:version",
            "autoUpdateFeedHeaders": {},
            "autoUpdateCheckOnStart": true
        },
    ```

    All builtin support will be definitely removed in January 2019.

## v1.7.0 <sup>28.09.2018</sup>
* [`electron`](https://github.com/electron/electron) was updated to `2.0.10`
* [`electron-builder`](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder) was updated to `20.28.4`
* `electron-builder-squirrel-windows` was updated to `20.28.3`
* new functionality/cli setting `--prod-debug` which forces devTools to be included in a production build, if you want this to be preserved after desktopHCP you need to run Meteor server with `METEOR_DESKTOP_PROD_DEBUG=1`

## v1.6.0 <sup>25.07.2018</sup>
* [`electron`](https://github.com/electron/electron) was updated to `2.0.5`
* [`electron-builder`](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder) was updated to `20.23.1`
* `electron-builder-squirrel-windows` was updated to `20.23.0`
* new functionality and new setting `exposedModules` which allows to expose any Electron renderer module i.e. `webFrame` which when defined in the settings will be available as `Desktop.electron.webFrame`
* fixed HCP switching to new version only after app restart

## v1.5.0 <sup>11.07.2018</sup>
* [`electron-builder`](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder) was updated to `20.20.0`
* `electron-builder-squirrel-windows` was updated to `20.19.0`

## v1.4.0 <sup>09.07.2018</sup>
* [`electron`](https://github.com/electron/electron) was updated to `2.0.4`

## v1.3.0 <sup>26.06.2018</sup>
* [`electron`](https://github.com/electron/electron) was updated to `2.0.3`
* [`electron-builder`](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder) was updated to `20.16.2` (once again thanks to [devlar](https://github.com/develar) for accepting meteor-desktop specific pull requests PR [electron-builder#2975](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/pull/2975))
* `electron-builder-squirrel-windows` was updated to `20.16.0`

## v1.2.0 <sup>18.06.2018</sup>
* `-i, --ignore-stderr [string]` cli cmd added, normally using `-b` when meteor outputs anything to stderr the build gets terminated, but in some cases you might want to avoid that when for example npm package throws a deprecation warning into stderr, now you can make the build continue

Example - `npm run desktop -- build-installer -b` gets terminated because `meteor run` outputs a `Node#moveTo was deprecated. Use Container#append.` warning to stderr. This will kill your build and prevent from going further. Because clearly that is something we can live with you can go forward with:
```  
npm run desktop -- build-installer -b -i "Node#moveTo"
```

You do not have to put the whole line, just any part of it that should only be found in that message.

## v1.1.0 <sup>23.05.2018</sup>
* `setDefaultFetchTimeout` and `call` methods added to both `Module` and `Desktop`
* [`electron`](https://github.com/electron/electron) was updated to `2.0.2`
* [`electron-builder`](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder) was updated to `20.14.7`   
* `electron-builder-squirrel-windows` was updated to `20.14.6`

**FIXES**
* fix [#165](https://github.com/wojtkowiak/meteor-desktop/issues/174) `meteor://` protocol is now registered as secure origin
* `bundler` caching was disabled for production builds as you might have accidentally get a development `desktop.asar` build into your production build

## v1.0.0 <sup>21.05.2018</sup>
Meteor App serving mechanism was changed to utilise `registerStreamProtocol` and serve
the app on constant `meteor://desktop` url instead of setting a http server which serves over `http://127.0.0.1:<random_port_on_every_start>`.

This finally solves the longstanding problems with `IndexedDB` and `localstorage` not being persistent.

Please verify thoroughly if your app is working fine after this change and reports any problems you encounter.

The localstorage contents will be migrated if you are updating your app from pre `1.0.0`.

However if you are using the `meteor-desktop-localstorage` plugin you have to make a migration yourself. The easiest way is to copy the plugin desktop code as your module in `.desktop` and on your app start get the contents with `getAll` and save them to the browser's localstorage.     

* [`electron`](https://github.com/electron/electron) was updated to `2.0.1`
* `MD_LOG_LEVEL` is now respected
* `-d`/`--debug` option added to run electron with `--debug=5858` switch
* `beforeLocalServerInit` event added to the `eventsBus`
* `METEOR_DESKTOP_DEBUG` now produces a lot more info from bundler plugin while building meteor project
* default installer in the scaffold for Windows is now set to `nsis`

**DEPRECATIONS:**
* builtin support for squirrel auto update

* support for the `meteor-desktop-localstorage` plugin is removed, you will not be able to use this plugin anymore

* [`electron`](https://github.com/electron/electron) was updated to `2.0.0`

it's more than sure that you will have to update your [`electron-builder`](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder)/[`electron-packager`](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager) configuration since it's a big shift from the old versions, create a new meteor project with blank scaffold (`npm run desktop -- init`) and take a look a the new `settings.json` as that might give you some hints
